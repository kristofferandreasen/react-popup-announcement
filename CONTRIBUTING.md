# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. ðŸ˜„

Before sending a Pull Request, consider making an issue in the repository and assigning it to yourself.

## Development

You need to clone the repository and install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kristofferandreasen/react-announcement.git
```

Then you can install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Now you are ready to add features to the component.
The project is bootstrapped with [create-react-library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library) and TypeScript has been added to the project. You can read more about the development workflow in the [project docs](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library).

Run npm start in both the main directory and the example directory in two separate terminals.
This way you will be able to see your changes on the example page when changes are made to the component.

```bash
npm start
```
